# Boating the Albemarle Sound in Style
The Albmemarle Sound is the largest freshwater sound in the Continental USA.  Six marinas located around the Sound offer 2 nights free dockage and other amenities to transient boaters.  Just tell the marina that you are "Doing the Albemarle Loop" when you make reservations for a stay.
